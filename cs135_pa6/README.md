# ProgrammingAssignment6

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1. Familiarize students with the use of **File IO**
2. Provide students with continued practice creating **functions**
### Important Notes:
1.	**Formatting**: Make sure that you follow the precise recommendations for the output content and formatting. For your testing purposes, the autograder will be comparing your output to that of the example executable.
2.	**Comments**: Header comments are required on all files and recommended for the rest of the program. Points will be deducted if no header comments are included.
3.	**Filename**: Save your program as ```songs.c```
## Program
It's a bop! Let's keep track of our favorite song playlists!  

## Requirements
This program should continue to prompt the user for an option until the user chooses to exit the program. In addition to exiting, the options should include:
- displaying a playlist
- creating a new playlist
- adding songs to an existing playlist

In addition to the main function, there ***must be*** at least 3 functions which perform the bulleted actions listed above. Getting the name of the playlist ***must be*** done in the main function. 

**TIPS!**
- When creating or adding songs to a playlist, the songs should not display to the screen. 
- You can use the ```cat``` command in the terminal or a text editor to view these playlists.

## Example Program Execution
### An example executable is provided in this repository.
- You should be able to run it from your project folder in a Linux environment. 
- If you encounter a “permission denied” error when attempting to run the executable, type  
```chmod u+x songsExecutable```  
into the terminal and try running the executable again.
- There is alreday an example playlist in the repository.
